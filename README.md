# Planeteers

Captain Planet needs our help! With everything that's going on in the world today, a new generation of Planeteers has risen up. However, Captain Planet is too busy fighting eco-terrorists to implement a React application of their own and it is our job to help their organize their data!

## Setup

After cloning down the project:

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
2. Run `npm start`. This will open both your backend on port `4000` and your React app on port `3000`.

In our React application, the data about the new generation of Planeteers is in the `db.json` file. This file will mimic an API that follows RESTful conventions.

## Endpoints

The base URL for your backend is: `http://localhost:4000`

These are the endpoints you might need:

- GET: `/planeteers`
- POST: `/planeteers`
- DELETE: `/planeteers/:id`

## What You Already Have

The `App` component holds four children: `Header`, `SearchBar`, `RandomButton`, and `PlaneteersContainer`. `Header`, `SearchBar`, and `RandomButton` have some starter code in them already. The `PlaneteersContainer` component will render all `Planeteer` components.

All of the code to style the page has been written for you, meaning that you should be adding to the code rather than editing it; however, if your finished product has some styling issues, don't worry too much about it.

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

<!-- - See list of planeteers on the page, using the `Planeteer` component. The `Planeteer` component should display the planeteer's image, name, bio, Twitter handle, and conditionally render where they are based. If they are from the USA, the component should say "USA-based", otherwise it should say "Working overseas". -->
<!-- - Click on the image of the planeteer in the `Planeteer` component and see the quote for that planeteer in place of the bio. If I click on the image again, the quote should again be replaced with the bio. If I click on another planeteer's image, it toggles that planeteer's bio independent of any other planeteer's. -->
- Type in the `SearchBar` component and see the list of planeteers whose name or bio match the text in the search bar. If there's no text in the search bar, all the planeteers should be rendered.

## Advanced Deliverables

These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to stretch your skills.

> Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure to have a working commit with all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user, I should be able to:

- See the age of the planeteer in the `Planeteer` component (To calculate the age, first figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript and then subtract the planeteer's birth year from it.)
- Click the `RandomButton` to render a random planeteer to the list of planeteers on the page. Additionally, the new random planeteer should be persisted to the database.
- Click on a checkbox in the `SearchBar` component that, when checked, sorts the planeteers in the `PlaneteersContainer` from youngest to oldest. When unchecked, the planeteers should be sorted by ID. When viewing a filtered list of planeteers, the sort should only sort the filtered list.
